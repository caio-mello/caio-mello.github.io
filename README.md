## Welcome to GitHub Pages

I'm a researcher interested in media studies, digital methods, urban studies and digital activism. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in Digital Humanities at the School of Advanced Study at the University of London.

 

My research explores the media coverage of the Olympic Games in a cross-cultural, cross-lingual and temporal perspective. I'm especially interested in comparing how the concept of 'Olympic legacy' has been approached by the Brazilian and British media considering different locations, languages and social-political contexts. This project is part of my work as an early-stage researcher at the Cleopatra ITN, a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network led by the L3S Research Center at the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz University of Hannover. ​

 

Besides, I'm also a journalist - although I rarely practice these days -and an amateur photographer in my free time. I have been experimenting with portraits in particular.
