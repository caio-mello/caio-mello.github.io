### About me

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Digital Humanities at the [School of Advanced Study](https://research.sas.ac.uk/search/staff/1581/mr-caio-mello/), University of London. I hold a BA in Journalism and a MA in Communication, both from the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Brazil. I work as an early-stage researcher at the University of London for the EU-funded Horizon 2020 project [CLEOPATRA](http://cleopatra-project.eu/), under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network. Before starting my PhD, I was a fellow researcher at [CAIS - Center for Advanced Internet Studies](https://www.cais.nrw/fellows/fellow_mello/) in Bochum, Germany. 


### My research

My current research is part of the CLEOPATRA project, which aims to explore major events that influence and shape our lives and our societies through advanced cross-lingual processing of textual and visual information.  

My project _Nationalism, internationalism and sporting identity: the London and Rio Olympics_ explores the media coverage of the Olympic Games in a cross-cultural, cross-lingual and temporal perspective. I'm especially interested in comparing how the concept of 'Olympic legacy' has been approached by the Brazilian and British media considering different locations, languages and social-political contexts. This research is conducted under the supervision of [Professor Jane Winters](https://research.sas.ac.uk/search/staff/126/professor-jane-winters) and [Martin Steer](https://research.sas.ac.uk/search/staff/405/mr-marty-steer/). 

My main research interests lie in the field of media studies, digital methods, urban studies and digital activism.
